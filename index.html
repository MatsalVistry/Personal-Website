                    Hi! I'm Vatsal. I am an Honors Computer Science major attending Texas A&M University. 
                    My current experience revolves around backend technologies and machine learning.

                    I am a team player. Working with others is my preferred way to learn and grow. I am confident in my abilities
                    and always looking to improve. I strive to be a software engineer at a major tech corporation as a new graduate.
